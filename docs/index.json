In this post, I will show how to write posts in my website in org with Hugo.\nHugo and ox-hugo This website is built using Hugo with the Academic Theme. I use ox-hugo, a org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown. To use ox-hugo, I add the following lines in the my configuration 1.\n;; webpage (require-package 'ox-hugo) (with-eval-after-load 'ox (require 'ox-hugo)) Create a org file in the directory, then I can write all my posts in org.\n  Writing Hugo Post in Emacs Org with ox-hugo   Directory and Section At the beginning of the file, specify the directory and section, it will export the markdown file to HUGO_BASE_DIR/content/HUGO_SECTION/.\n#+HUGO_SECTION: en/post #+HUGO_BASE_DIR:~/academic-homepage #+hugo_weight: auto For example, with the above setting, this post will be exported in ~/academic-homepage/content/en/post/.\nEnable Auto Export At the end of the file, add the following to enable auto-export. Then every time you save the org file, ox-hugo will automatically export the files.\n# Local Variables: # eval: (org-hugo-auto-export-mode) # End: Exporting Properties for each Post The heading would become the title of the post. Use C-c C-q the set the tags, which would become the tags for the post.

In previous post, I introduced some packages and my workflow in Emacs for $\\LaTeX$ and bibolography management. In this post, I will introduce the configuration and usage of Emacs as an alternative to Rstudio.\nEmacs as a GUI for R I use ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics). With the package installed, you could start an R session in Emacs with M-x r (Press Alt and x together, then enter r). It will ask you to set up the directory.\n  R session in Emacs with ESS   iESS [R]: interactive mode It is now just R in terminal. You can try some commands. If you plot something, the figure would pop up in a seperate window.   ESS Plot   You can also save the buffer as usual in a file and edit it. One useful command here is ess-transcript-clean-buffer, with which only the commands are kept.   Clean the Transcript: Command     Clean the Transcript: Result   ESS with R script Open an R script in Emacs, e.g., the file created by cleaning the transcript above, use the following commands to evaluate a line, a region or the total buffer.\n   Command Description Command Description     C-c C-j loading line C-c C-r loading region   C-c C-f evaluate function C-c C-b evaluate buffer          Org and R I use Orgmode in Emacs for note-taking, and prefer it to rmarkdown.\nR Code Block in Org With Babel, a package now part of org-mode, we could create a block for R code (or other languages) and run it. In an org buffer, enter \u0026lt;s and then press Enter, it will generate a block for source code as below.\n#+BEGIN_SRC #+END_SRC Enter your codes and press C-c to run the code.\n   R code block in org.   To export, press C-c C-e and choose the format you\u0026rsquo;d like to export such as html or pdf as shown below.   Export the result with the R code and the result.   Export Table in $\\LaTeX$ Below is another example using the stargazer package in R to export tables in $\\LaTeX$. As it requires the package dcolumn in $\\LaTeX$, you should add\n#+LATEX_HEADER: \\usepackage{dcolumn} at the head or the org file.\n* Another Example with Table #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output latex :exports results library(stargazer) ## 2 OLS models linear.1 \u0026lt;- lm(rating ~ complaints + privileges + learning + raises + critical,data=attitude) linear.2 \u0026lt;- lm(rating ~ complaints + privileges + learning, data=attitude) ## create an indicator dependent variable, and run a probit model attitude$high.rating \u0026lt;- (attitude$rating \u0026gt; 70) probit.model \u0026lt;- glm(high.rating ~ learning + critical + advance, data=attitude,family = binomial(link = \u0026quot;probit\u0026quot;)) stargazer(linear.1, linear.2, probit.model, title=\u0026quot;Results\u0026quot;, align=TRUE) #+END_SRC    Export the Results of OLS in a Table.   See the Manual for more setting of the code blocks.\nGit in Emacs  Magit is an interface of Git in Emacs. Assume that you have already create a github repository in the directory containing the above file R-data-science.R. Press C-x g to get the git status, press s to stage the file.   Get git status by C-x g.   To commit, press c you will see a menu, then press c to enter the message.   Git Commit.   To Push, press P, and choose the place to push, e.g., u for origin/master. Then it will ask you to enter youruser name in github.   Git Push.   And then enter you password and it\u0026rsquo;s done.   The git status after Push.

mechanisms are critical in determining the assignments of students to schools. We used agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the three mechanisms experienced in the fiercely competitive admission systems in China: serial dictatorship (SD), the Boston mechanism (BM), and the Chinese parallel mechanism (CP). We evaluated their multifaceted outcomes under different policy settings, school capacities, and behavioral assumptions. We have replicated their major characteristics found in the analytical models and showed that CP behaves as a hybrid of SD and BM. ABM allows us to distinguish their aggregate effects from distributional effects and their long-term level effects from short-term volatility effects. We found that this kind of “out-of-equilibrium’’ analysis, while mostly absent in the analytical equilibrium analysis, is crucial for practical policy analysis.","tags":["Agent-based Modeling"],"title":"Matching Impacts of School Admission Mechanisms: An Agent-Based Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","刘凤义"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"b4d4a28ab4c8fd232f77fcb24e5897c2","permalink":"https://people.umass.edu/weikaichen/publication/%E6%96%B0%E8%BF%9B%E5%B1%9515/","publishdate":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/%E6%96%B0%E8%BF%9B%E5%B1%9515/","section":"publication","summary":"为发展当代中国马克思主义政治经济学,有必要关注和借鉴国外政治经济学的新发展。本文对2015年国外政治经济学研究进行了梳理,选取在基本理论创新和当代资本主义经济现实两方面研究的新进展,并着重介绍了数理模型和计量分析等现代分析工具在马克思主义政治经济学相关问题上的运用,如资本循环模型、再生产模型的扩展,对利润率和不平等的经验研究等。希望这一整理工作能够为学界同仁提供一些研究的线索,为我们推进当代中国马克思主义政治经济学的研究提供新思想。","tags":["国外政治经济学","新进展"],"title":"国外政治经济学研究的新进展(2015)","type":"publication"}]

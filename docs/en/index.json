In previous post, I introduced some packages and my workflow in Emacs for $\\LaTeX$ and bibolography management. In this post, I will introduce the configuration and usage of Emacs as an alternative to Rstudio.\nEmacs as a GUI for R I use ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics). With the package installed, you could start an R session in Emacs with M-x r (Press Alt and x together, then enter r). It will ask you to set up the directory.\n  R session in Emacs with ESS   iESS [R]: interactive mode It is now just R in terminal. You can try some commands. If you plot something, the figure would pop up in a seperate window.   ESS Plot   You can also save the buffer as usual in a file and edit it. One useful command here is ess-transcript-clean-buffer, with which only the commands are kept.   Clean the Transcript: Command     Clean the Transcript: Result   ESS with R script Open an R script in Emacs, e.g., the file created by cleaning the transcript above, use the following commands to evaluate a line, a region or the total buffer.\n   Command Description Command Description     C-c C-j loading line C-c C-r loading region   C-c C-f evaluate function C-c C-b evaluate buffer          Org and R I use Orgmode in Emacs for note-taking, and prefer it to rmarkdown.\nR Code Block in Org With Babel, a package now part of org-mode, we could create a block for R code (or other languages) and run it. In an org buffer, enter \u0026lt;s and then press Enter, it will generate a block for source code as below.\n#+BEGIN_SRC #+END_SRC Enter your codes and press C-c to run the code.\n   R code block in org.   To export, press C-c C-e and choose the format you\u0026rsquo;d like to export such as html or pdf as shown below.   Export the result with the R code and the result.   Export Table in $\\LaTeX$ Below is another example using the stargazer package in R to export tables in $\\LaTeX$. As it requires the package dcolumn in $\\LaTeX$, you should add\n#+LATEX_HEADER: \\usepackage{dcolumn} at the head or the org file.\n* Another Example with Table #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output latex :exports results library(stargazer) ## 2 OLS models linear.1 \u0026lt;- lm(rating ~ complaints + privileges + learning + raises + critical,data=attitude) linear.2 \u0026lt;- lm(rating ~ complaints + privileges + learning, data=attitude) ## create an indicator dependent variable, and run a probit model attitude$high.rating \u0026lt;- (attitude$rating \u0026gt; 70) probit.model \u0026lt;- glm(high.rating ~ learning + critical + advance, data=attitude,family = binomial(link = \u0026quot;probit\u0026quot;)) stargazer(linear.1, linear.2, probit.model, title=\u0026quot;Results\u0026quot;, align=TRUE) #+END_SRC    Export the Results of OLS in a Table.   See the Manual for more setting of the code blocks.\nGit in Emacs  Magit is an interface of Git in Emacs. Assume that you have already create a github repository in the directory containing the above file R-data-science.R. Press C-x g to get the git status, press s to stage the file.   Get git status by C-x g.   To commit, press c you will see a menu, then press c to enter the message.   Git Commit.   To Push, press P, and choose the place to push, e.g., u for origin/master. Then it will ask you to enter youruser name in github.   Git Push.   And then enter you password and it\u0026rsquo;s done.   The git status after Push.   Check the Reference Card for more usages.\n","date":1569787031,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569787031,"objectID":"aef6e083136a29a94e91f68f16296978","permalink":"https://people.umass.edu/weikaichen/en/post/emacs-ess-r/","publishdate":"2019-09-29T15:57:11-04:00","relpermalink":"/en/post/emacs-ess-r/","section":"post","summary":"The customization of Emacs as an alternative to Rstudio with ESS and Magit.","tags":["Emacs","ESS","Magit"],"title":"Emacs for R and Git","type":"post"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Course Information  Instructor: Samuel Bowles Teaching Assistant: Weikai Chen Primary text: Bowles (2004), Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution.

Search for entries   Press M-o (Alt + o) to show the actions.   The Menu of possible Actions.

We used agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the three mechanisms experienced in the fiercely competitive admission systems in China: serial dictatorship (SD), the Boston mechanism (BM), and the Chinese parallel mechanism (CP). We evaluated their multifaceted outcomes under different policy settings, school capacities, and behavioral assumptions. We have replicated their major characteristics found in the analytical models and showed that CP behaves as a hybrid of SD and BM. ABM allows us to distinguish their aggregate effects from distributional effects and their long-term level effects from short-term volatility effects. We found that this kind of “out-of-equilibrium’’ analysis, while mostly absent in the analytical equilibrium analysis, is crucial for practical policy analysis.","tags":["Agent-based Modeling"],"title":"Matching Impacts of School Admission Mechanisms: An Agent-Based Approach","type":"publication"}]

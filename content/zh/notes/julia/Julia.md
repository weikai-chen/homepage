## Introduction {#introduction}

This is my study note on [Julia](http:www.julialang.org). I decide to use Julia as my preminary programming language for almost everything, including data analysis and scientific computing.

In these notes, I will start from the basics of Julia programming in the first part. In the second part, I will focus on data analysis, including a review on statistics using Julia, the basics of econometrics and statistical learning. The third part would consist of the elements of scientific computation, including the numerical linear algebra and so on.

This note would play a role as the reference note or cheatsheet, providing the sample code for the aligorithm and graphics that might be used in my research and teaching.

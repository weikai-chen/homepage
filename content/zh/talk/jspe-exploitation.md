title: Persistent Exploitation with Intertemporal Reproducible Solution in Pre-industrial Economies. 
event: The 67th Annual Conference of the Japan Society of Political Economy (JSPE)
event_url: https://jspe.gr.jp/en/node/166
location: Komazawa University, Japan
abstract: This paper presents an intertemporal model of pre-industrial economies defined with leisure preference to study the condition of the emergence and persistence of exploitation as unequal exchange of labor.  We show that pure workers are exploitedin any finite periods if there is positive real profit rate, even though labor allocation among agents tends to be equalized in the limit regardless of the saving behaviors. The so-called Fundamental Marxian Theorem and Profit-Exploitation Correspondence Principle are generalized in the intertemporal setting with exploitation in thewhole life, and the Class-Exploitation Correspondence Principle is established withexploitation within period.


summary: We show that pure workers are exploitedin any finite periods if there is positive real profit rate, even though labor allocation among agents tends to be equalized in the limit regardless of the saving behaviors.

title: Inequality and Evolution of Network Structure
event: Graduate Workshop in Computational Social Science Modeling and Complexity 2017
event_url: "https://wiki.santafe.edu/index.php/Graduate_Workshop_in_Computational_Social_Science_Modeling_and_Complexity_2017"
location: Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe, New Mexico
summary: "The emergence of economic inequality and political hierarchy during the early Holocene might be explained partly in the equilibrium network structure supportedby the ecological and social conditions (Bowles, 2009). Kets, Iyengar, Sethi, andBowles (2011) provide a device -- the size of the maximum independent set -- as an alternative to various measures of centrality as the key determinant of the maximum inequality sustainable in a given network. In this project, using methods outlined in Jackson (2010), instead of taking the structure as given, we study the formation of network structure under varying ecological and social conditions. "

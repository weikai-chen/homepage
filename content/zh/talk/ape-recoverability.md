title: Recoverability from the Input-Output Data
subtitle: Foundation of Empirical Multisectoral Analysis
event: Analytical Political Economy Workshop
event_url: ""
location: University of Massachusetts, Amherst
summary: "What information can we recover from the aggregate nominal data? What can we actually say about the labor value, the rate of profit and the wage-profit frontier in practice?"
abstract: "In this project, I explore the foundation of empirical multisectoral analysis to cover the gap between the theoretical analysis based on the non-aggregating physical coefficients and the empirical studies using the aggregate nominal input-output table following Leontief and Stone. The aim is to provide a comprehensive study on **recoverability problem**: what information can we recover from the aggregate nominal data? What can we actually say about the labor value, the rate of profit and the wage-profit frontier in practice?"

title: Technical Change, Income Distribution, and Profitability in Multisectoral Linear Economies
event: New School -- Umass Graduate Workshop
event_url: ""
location: New School, New York
summary: "Any viable capital-using and labor-saving (CU-LS) technical change would bring about a fall in the profit rate if labor share is unaffected, taking into account the complicated movement of relative prices in a multisectoral setting."
abstract: "I show that any viable capital-using and labor-saving (CU-LS) technical change would unaffected, taking into account the complicated movement of relative prices in a multisectoral setting. Challenging the conventional view, this result conclusively supports the law of declining rate of profit as an underlying economic force. Furthermore, if the rate of profit does not fall after CU-LS technical change then labor share must decline, which creates a dilemma: to avoid the instability brought by the declining profit rate, the society has no choice but to squeeze labor share and intensify the conflicts over income distribution."

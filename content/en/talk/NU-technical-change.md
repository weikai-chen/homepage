title: Technical Change, Income Distribution, and Profitability in Multisectoral Linear Economies
event: New School -- Umass Graduate Workshop
event_url: ""
location: New School, New York
summary: "Any viable capital-using and labor-saving technical change itself (in the absence of power change) would bring about a fall in the rate of profit. This result conclusively supports the argument of the falling rate of profit due to a rising organic composition of capital as an underlying economic force."
abstract: "This paper analyzes the effect of technical change on income distribution and profitability by comparing the long-run outcomes defined by a uniform profit rate in a multisector linear economy. We study three scenarios with (i) fixed real wage; (ii) fixed profit rate; or (iii) fixed wage-profit ratio, and show that any viable capital-using and labor-saving technical change itself (in the absence of power change) would bring about a fall in the rate of profit. Profit rate would not rise unless the technical change is so power-biased against the working-class that the wage-profit ratio can not be maintained. Our result conclusively supports the argument of the falling rate of profit due to a rising organic composition of capital as an underlying economic force."
